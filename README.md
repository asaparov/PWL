**Warning:** This is a work-in-progress as I'm running more experiments so things may break without notice. But if you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them.

This code depends on OpenSSL as well as the following repositories: [core](https://github.com/asaparov/core), [math](https://github.com/asaparov/math), [hdp](https://github.com/asaparov/hdp), and [grammar](https://github.com/asaparov/grammar).

To use this code, download the repository and dependencies and run `make executive_test` and then `./executive_test`.
